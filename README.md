# ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING
## (Napredno strojno učenje)

Homework for the course "Napredno strojno učenje" held at Faculty of mathematics and physics in academic year 2020/21 .

It consists of 4 homeworks from five different machine learning topics:

1. Meta-learning,
2. Learning from data streams,
3. Learning from complex data types,
4. Equation discovery and symolic regression,
5. Other topics.

All code is written in Python with use of Jupyter notebook.

2. Learning from data streams:
  - properties of data streams and learning limitations,
  - statisctics coputing and changes evaluation,
  - FIMT-DD algorithm for decision tree learning,
  - ADWIN algorithm for window adaptation,
  - nearest neighbours methods in data stream learning.

3. Learning from complex data types:
  - word embeddings (word2vec),
  - graph embeddings with node2vec,
  - edge embeddings and graph neural net,
  - relation learning and learning in first order logic,
  - proportionalization of relation data.

4. Equation discovery and symolic regression:
  - Simple heuristics for equation discovery,
  - Equation discovery, proportionalization and regularization: sparse linear regression,
